  <section title="Introduction">
    Construo is a simple 2D construction programm (it is currently
    not a real game) for objects which consist of rods and springs
    and let them react on physical forces. You can currently
    construct buildings and objects like bridges, towers,
    spaceshuttles, etc. and you let them fall to ground and see seem
    smash and break. Sound like fun, doesn't it =;-)
    
    The game is similar to <link
      ref="http://ofs.powertie.org/">Bridge Builder</link> and
    heavily inspired from the <link
      ref="http://www.gamasutra.com">Gamasutra</link> article <link
      ref="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000208/lander_01.htm">Collision
      Response: Bouncy, Trouncy, Fun</link>. Its covered under the
    <link ref="http://www.gnu.org/copyright/gpl.html">GNU General
      Public License</link>, thats means source code is availabel and
    you are allowed to modify it.

  <section title="ToDo">
    The 'thing' is currently useable for constructing simple 2D
    objects, but there is really quite a lot stuff missing. There is
    currently no way to set different parameters for rods or springs,
    change their color or thikness. It has only basic load and save
    support. Support for larger models, zooming and scrolling would
    also be very nice, last not least 3D support would be really nice.
    Building with prefabs could also be fun. Colliding rods would also
    be a usefull feature, currently only rod-ground collision is
    implemented. The <tt>TODO</tt> file in the source directory
    contains a few more infos.

      shouldn't have problems compiling it. Binary version for 0.1.0
      might follow at a later point.
