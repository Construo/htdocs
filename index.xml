  <section title="Introduction">
      Construo is a simple 2D construction programm (it is currently
      not a real game) for objects which consist of rod's and springs
      and let them react on physical forces. You can currently
      construct buildings and objects like bridges, towers,
      spaceshuttles, etc. and you let them fall to ground and the seem
      smash and break. Sound like fun, doesn't it =;-)
    
      The game is similar to <link
	ref="http://ofs.powertie.org/">Bridge Builder</link> and
	heavily inspired from the <link

    <subsection title="Source Code">
      To compile it you also need libxml2 and ClanLib, if you don't
      know what I am talking about, just use the binary, it will save
      you a lot of throuble.
