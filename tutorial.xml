    <p>
      Welcome to the Construo Tutorial Version 0.2.0. This short
      tutorial or manual should give you an overview about what
      Construo can do and how to use it.
    </p>

    <subsection title="The Display Target">
      <p>
        The first step to start construo is to select the correct
        display target for you, at the moment there are both X11 and
        Glut (OpenGL) versions of Construo available. The X11 version
        looks sharper and as good fonts, while the Glut one provides
        anti-aliased lines and OpenGL hardware acceleration when
        available. Best is you simply try both and pick the one that
        works better for you, since both are compatible with each
        other you can switch from one to the other without a problem.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Workspace">
      <p>
        If you start up Construo you will be placed directly onto the
        workspace. At the left you have load, save, quit, undo and
        redo buttons, together with the run, slowmotian, actioncam and
        hidedot buttons. While on the right you have the tool buttons
        (insert, select collider, zoom), which controll what your
        mouse will do on the work space. At the top you can see all
        the keyboard shortcuts available and at the bottom you can see
        position, frames per seconds and other statistics about your
        model. 
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection title="The Buttons">
      <subsubsection title="Run">
        <p>
          Probally the most important button, since it will start the
          simulation, letting forces act on your model, letting it
          break or bend. Note that you can even in simulation mode use
          all the modeling functions, so you can remove springs and
          dots and see what happens.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Slow Motion">
        <p>
          This button simply turn the simulation into slow motion
          mode, giving you more time the see what is happening.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Hide Dots">
        The Hide Dots button simply hides all dots, so that they are
        invisible, this might not be something you want to use in the
        modeling, but it will speed up the drawing a bit in the
        simulation, it also leads to diferent visuell results.
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Undo">
        <p>
          Undo's the last action, like removal of a spring or dot, it
          also reverses the model to the state before running the
          simulation. Unlimited numbers of undo are provided.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Redo">
        <p>
          Redo will simply undo an 'Undo' command, thus bringing the
          model into the state before the undo.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Load">
        <p>
          This will bring you to the file dialog, it is a graphical
          dialog where you simply click on the thumbnail to have the
          model loaded. Construo uses its own virtual filesystem,
          which will lock you into <tt>~/.construo/</tt>, so if you
          want to load a model that you downloaded from the internet
          copy it to your <tt>~/.construo/</tt> directory first or
          load it from the command line.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Save">
        <p>
          This is similar to the load button, but instead of bringing
          you to the load dialog it will bring you to the save dialog.
          The <tt>..:: Save to new file ::..</tt> button will allow
          you to save to a new file, while clicking onto a thumbnail
          will save over the thumbnail. Construo generates filenames
          on its own, so you don't have and at the moment can't give
          one.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Quit">
        <p>
          The quit button, does what it always does, it closes the
          application. The quit button closes without confirming if
          you havn't saved, but don't worry, since it saves
          automatically the last model on the workspace no data-loss
          will happen. Once you start construo again you will see the
          model that you had on your workspace as you quitted.
          <em>Note: Undo steps are at the moment not saved, so there
            is still the possibility of data-loss if you quit while
            running the simulation. See the appendant <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=4442&amp;group_id=644">bug report</a>.</em>

    <subsection title="The Toolbox">
      <p>
        Construo provides at the moment 4 tools, the insert tool, the
        select tool, the collider tool and the zoom tool.
      </p>

      <subsubsection title="Insert Tool">
        <p>
          The insert tool allows you to insert dots and springs. A
          single click into empty space will insert a dot and connect
          a spring to it, which will be connected to a second dot if
          you click again with the left mouse button. If you don't
          like the spring, simply click the right button to chancel
          it. If you click onto an already existing dot you will not
          create a new one, but connect a spring to the dot, which you
          than can connect to another spring or again chancel with the
          right button.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Select Tool">
        <p>
          The select tool is used to select groups of dots and allows
          you to move them arround by simply clicking on a dot in the
          selection and dragging it around. Using the right button
          will allow you to rotate the selection and pressing 'v' will
          set the velocity of the dots (indicated by the blue
          lines).
        </p>
      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection title="Collider Tool">
        <p>
          The collider tool allows you to place fixed blocks onto your
          workspace. These blocks don't react on forces, but simply
          provide a collision object where your spring construction
          can stand on, basically like the ground. To place a collider
          simple click&amp;drag a rectangle of the wished size.
          Click&amp;drag on an already existing collider will allow
          you to move it and right clicking will you allow to delete
          existing colliders.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>
      
      <subsubsection title="Zoom Tool">
        <p>
          The zoom tool allows you to simply zoom into areas of your
          workspace, left click drags a rectangle of the area you want
          to zoom into and a right click zooms you out.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Keyboard Shortcuts">
      <p>
        Nearly every function in Construo is available via a keyboard
        shortcut, the context sensitive help at the top of the screen
        list them all.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection title="Constructing Something">
      <p>
        Ok, now that we have the manual part behind us, start with
        constructing something and once you done with it, don't forget
        to send in any interesting stuff you have created.
