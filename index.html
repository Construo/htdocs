  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
      Construo is a simple 2D construction programm (it is currently
      not a real game) for objects which consist of rods and springs
      and let them react on physical forces. You can currently
      construct buildings and objects like bridges, towers,
      spaceshuttles, etc. and you let them fall to ground and the seem
      smash and break. Sound like fun, doesn't it =;-)
    
      The game is similar to <a href="http://ofs.powertie.org/">Bridge Builder</a> and
	heavily inspired from the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com">Gamasutra</a> article <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000208/lander_01.htm">Collision
	Response: Bouncy, Trouncy, Fun</a>. Its covered under the
	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyright/gpl.html">GNU General
	Public License</a>, thats means source code is availabel and
	you are allowed to modify it.

  <h2>ToDo</h2>
<p>
    The 'thing' is currently useable for constructing simple 2D
    objects, but there is really quite a lot stuff missing. There is
    currently no way to set different parameters for rods or springs,
    change their color or thikness. It has only basic load and save
    support and the requirement for ClanLib and libxml are not really
    needed. It should probally be based on freeglut or someother simple
    OpenGL library. Support for larger models, zooming and scrolling
    would also be very nice, last not least 3D support would be really
    nice. Building with prefabs could also be fun. Colliding rods
    would also be a usefull feature, currently only rod-ground
    collision is implemented. I currently lack the time to do anything
    for this project, so help would be very welcome.
  </p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
    
      OS:GNU/Linux (probally also Windows in the future)
      CPU:something really fast as the game is not at all optimized

  <h2>Download</h2>
<p>
    <h3>Static Binaries</h3>
<p>
      These are statically linked binaries, that means they run
      without any extra requiremed libraries (except X11 and a
      GNU/Linux box).

      <ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://freesoftware.fsf.org/download/construo/construo-0.0.2-binary-i386.tar.gz">construo-0.0.2-binary-i386.tar.gz</a>
</li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>
      To compile it you also need libxml2 and ClanLib, if you don't
      know what I am talking about, just use the binary, it will save
      you a lot of throuble.
